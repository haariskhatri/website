# 👋🏽 Hello

<div class="home-container">

  <div class="home-content">

Hey there! I’m Haaris, and I’m currently at [Minddeft](https://www.minddeft.com), where I dive into the world of backend engineering and DevOps. My go-to tools are Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins, and I'm also on a journey to expand my cloud knowledge, especially with AWS. Programing languages I feel comfortable with are Javascript, and Go.

I love spending hours automating tasks that would take mere minutes if done manually—there’s just something about turning those minutes into magic that I find really rewarding! Every day, I stumble upon something new that sparks my curiosity, and I can’t wait to document those discoveries here.

When I’m not glued to my screen, you’ll likely find me on a drive to my village in Kutch, playing cricket at the local turf, hanging out at [Declutter](https://www.instagram.com/declutter.health?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==) with some awesome folks discussing mental health, or getting lost in video editing.

Also, I enjoy listening to music a lot. You can check out my playlist here: [Playlist](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIHTSX-zoYFCVGi9BQcm_70Ev6qjCitiA&si=kJo6Xxlc7QzNPiaG)
